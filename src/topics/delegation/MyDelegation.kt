/*
 * Delegation is critical when one chooses composition over inheritance.
 *
 * The by-clause in the supertype list for Delegate indicates that b will be stored internally in objects of Delegate,
 * and the compiler will generate all the methods of B that forward to b.
 *
 * Delegated properties : a property that delegates its getter (and its setter if a var) to "something else".
 * A delegated property also uses the by keyword.
