/*
 * A sequence is a container Sequence<T> with type T.
 * Itâ€™s also an interface, including intermediate operations like map() and filter(), as well as terminal operations
 * like count() and find().
 * Like Streams in Java, Sequences in Kotlin execute lazily.
 * It has tremendous potential to boost application performance while working with large collections.
 * On the other hand, there is an overhead to sequences when processing small collections

    // In the first example, each operator introduces an intermediate collection. So, all ten elements pass to a map()
    // function.
    // In the second example, there are no intermediate collections introduced, thus map() function has only
    // five elements as input.
