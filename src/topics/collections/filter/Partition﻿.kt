/*
 * partition() â€“ filters a collection by a predicate and keeps the elements that don't match it in a separate list.
 * So, you have a Pair of Lists as a return value:
 *  1- the first list containing elements that match the predicate and
 *  2- the second one containing everything else from the original collection.
