/*
 * Two ways of injecting dependencies:
 * Constructor injection: Where dependencies are passed through the constructor.
 * Field injection: Where dependencies are passed through setter methods or by changing the instance variables.
 * This can also be referred to as setter injection, and it can also be expanded to interface injection in which
 * the setter method is abstracted to an interface.
